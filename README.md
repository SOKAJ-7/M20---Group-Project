Machine Learning Model

      We decided to use the Random Forest decision tree model, as it is the most fitting for a large dataset such as ours. To gage similarities and make predictions using our data, the Random Forest model will take the average of numerous trees. This will also work with our dataset, as we have 10 + metrics we would like to subset and assess. Having predictions from multiple trees will allow us to discover which of these metrics have the largest impact on songs by popular artists. In comparison, a decision tree model would be quite limiting with this dataset, as we would have to presume which metrics are strongly correlated with the popularity of songs and reduce the number we select, thereby leading our data to be potentially skewed.
