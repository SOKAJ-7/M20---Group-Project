# M20---Group 11 Project-- EDA

The databse we are working with has 232,725 rows (each row represent a song) and 18 columns (those are diverse categories like genre, artist name, etc.). 
As seen in the EDA_Spotify_checkpoint_2.ipynb file, some histograms were made to represent the distribution of our data in some of the columns.
