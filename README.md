# M20---Group 11 Project-- EDA

The databse we are working with has 232,725 rows (each row represent a song) and 18 columns (those are diverse categories like genre, artist name, etc.). 
As seen in the EDA_Spotify_checkpoint_2.ipynb file, some histograms were made to represent the distribution of our data in some of the columns. 
We can say that the majority of the songs have a speechiness between 0.0 and 0.2. Instrumentalness is also very close to 0.0. The majority of the Danceability indicator is between 06 and 0.9. The vast majority of the songs popularity's is between 50 and 80. For further details please see the  EDA_Spotify_checkpoint_2.ipynb file.
