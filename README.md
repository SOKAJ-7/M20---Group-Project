# M20---Group 11 Project


## Communication Protocols
Prior to designing our project each member shared their availability for all 7 days of the week with the rest of the group in a Whatsapp group chat. During this project, written communication will take place on the aforementioned Whatsapp chat as well as the Group chat on Slack which includes our Teaching Assistant for the project, Jose. For vocal communication, our group will be meeting every Tuesday and Thursday for our scheduled class as well as scheduling additional meetings on the weekend as necessary. Information and documents that each member would like to share can also be posted to a group Google Docs document which has allowed for collaboration on designing the project and machine learning model. Additionally, each group member has been added to a GitHub where we can upload our work and comment on other's code.
